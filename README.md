# Ashes - Social Media Platform Frontend

**Ashes** is a social media platform where users can create posts and reels, follow other users, like and comment on posts, search for people, manage their profiles, and send messages to friends.

This repository contains the frontend part of the Ashes project, built with React.js. It connects to the backend API (built with Spring Boot) to provide a complete social media experience.

**Key Features:**
- User registration and login
- Profile management
- Following and unfollowing users
- Creating posts and reels
- Liking and commenting on posts
- Searching for other users
- Messaging friends

The frontend handles the user interface and interactions, while the backend manages authentication, data storage, and API logic.
